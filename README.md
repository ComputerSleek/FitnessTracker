# FitnessTracker

A fitness tracker app that uses Mongo and Mongoose functionality with Express routes.

## About

This app uses Express web server, and a MongoDB database to store the Workout data. Also, it uses Mongoose to set up the schema for the Workout objects and interact with the database. The <html> pages are served to the user via a set of <html> routes, and database queries are defined using a set of API routes.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
